# @ow3/playground

This folder contains the files for your development playground.

## How is the Playground different from an example?

The playground is almost the "same" as an example. The difference lies in the dependencies that are required: the playground requires a locally symlinked version (enabled via `pnpm run dev`'s passive watching) and an examples requires the dependencies direct from npm.

For those reasons, the playground is perfectly suited for your local development.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
pnpm test
```
