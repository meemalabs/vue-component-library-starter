# @ow3/hello-world-elements

"Why create components for a specific framework when it can be written to be understood by all ‚Äî including browsers?"

## üí° Get Started

Before you get started, it is important to understand what a Web Component is. Think of it as a (custom) HTML element. This custom element can natively be used within your framework-of-choice. That being said, this is an opinionated starter kit, employing many best-practices to help you expedite the development of your reusable component library.

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
npx degit openwebstacks/stacks-framework hello-world-stack
cd hello-world-stack

pnpm i # install deps for all packages
pnpm dev # stubs the libraries for local use
pnpm dev:vite-wc # starts the dev server
pnpm build # builds all packages for production-ready use
```

Additionally, the `package.json` contains some useful snippets you likely want to be aware of.

## ü§ñ Usage

Because this project is optimized toward the development of easily reusable & composable component libraries, it's very easy to use (and distribute):

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <hello-world name="Jane Doe"></hello-world>
    <script src="elements.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Tips

This project also includes a simple way to handle your versioning. Through semantic commit names, it will also generate the two changelogs: one as part of the GitHub releases & the one markdown file that's stored within the root of the project.

```bash
# how to create a git commit?
git add . # select the changes you want to commit
pnpm run commit # then simply follow the prompts

# after you successfully committed, you may create a "release"
pnpm run release # automates git commits, versioning, and CHANGELOG generation
```
