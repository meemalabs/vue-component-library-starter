_Pre-release until public beta released. Coming May/June._

The goal of the framework is to _help you_ create & maintain frontends, backends, and clouds‚Äîwithout having to worry about the boilerplate. Stacks is a rapid application development framework, meeting all your full stack needs.

- Web & Desktop applications
- Serverless & traditional APIs
- Cloud infrastructure creation & maintenance
- Interactive CLIs
- Framework-agnostic component & function libraries
- Deployment & Release Manager _(CI & CD)_

Stacks helps you every step along the way‚Äîin beginner & expert-friendly ways, allowing you to focus on the _what_ and _why_ of your project.

> ‚ÄúConvention over configuration‚Äù is the Stacks mantra. _- Chris_

No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, the approachable Stacks design allows you to learn at your own pace, using our thorough documentation covering every aspect of the framework. Stacks is extremely beginner & expert-friendly.

Develop beautiful, reactive, composable UIs without learning a new set of languages. HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript‚Äîthat's all you need to dive in now! _Or TypeScript ‚úåüèº_

> _A true rapid application development framework for all Full Stack needs. Next-level simplicity & helpful DX._

## Get Started

It's incredibly easy to get started with this framework. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sh <(curl stacksjs.dev)

# alternatively, if Node.js >= v18.12 is installed already,
# you may also get started via:
npx stacks new my-project
```

> **Note**
> pnpm 8 required. _Run the setup script & üê∂ Buddy will set you up. He barks otherwise._

## ü§ñ Usage

The following list includes some of the most common ways to interact with the Stacks API. Meet the toolkit, Buddy:

```bash
buddy install # installs all dependencies
buddy dev # starts one of the dev servers (components, functions, pages, or docs)
buddy build # follow CLI prompts to select which library (or server) to build
buddy commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
buddy release # creates the releases for the stack & consequently, publishes them to npm
buddy upgrade # auto-update deps & the Stacks framework

buddy make:component HelloWorld # scaffolds a component
buddy make:function HelloWorld # scaffolds a function
buddy make:page hello-world # scaffolds a page (https://my-project.test/hello-world)

buddy --help
```

<details>

```bash
buddy --version # get the Stacks version
buddy --help # view help menu
# please note: you may suffix any command with the
# `command --help` flag to review the help menu

buddy install # installs your dependencies
buddy fresh # fresh reinstall of all deps
buddy clean # removes all your deps

buddy update # auto-update deps & the Stacks framework
buddy update:dependencies # auto-update deps & the Stacks framework

# for Laravel folks, `serve` may ring more familiar than the `dev` name. Hence, we aliased it:
buddy serve
buddy serve:components
buddy serve:pages
buddy serve:functions
buddy serve:docs

# building for production (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, npm, Vercel, Netlify, et al.)
buddy build # select a specific build (follow CLI prompts)

## üìö Utilizing the Built Libraries

Because Stacks optimizes the development of easily reusable & composable component & function libraries, the primary intention is to always _keep it simple, yet configurable._

By default, Stacks realizes whether your Stack includes components, functions, and/or pages. Based on that determination, Stacks builds your outputs.

The UI libraries that automatically get built are: a Web Component (Custom Elements) & Vue Component library.

<details>
<summary>Web Component usage</summary>

```bash
npm install my-awesome-library
```

After you installed your Stacks generated library, you can use a "Custom Element" (Web Component) in the following way:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <hello-world name="Jane Doe"></hello-world>
    <script src="my-awesome-library.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Vue 2 & 3 usage</summary>

```bash
npm install my-awesome-library
```

After you installed your Stacks generated library, you can use your Vue Components in the following way:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from 'my-awesome-library'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```

</details>

_A function library may also be automatically generated._

<details>
<summary>Functions usage</summary>

```bash
npm install hello-world-library
```

After you installed your Stacks generated library, you can use your functions in the following way:

```ts
import { count, increment } from 'hello-world-fx'

console.log('count is', count)
increment()
console.log('increased count is', count)
```

</details>

You may view this framework as an incredibly ‚Äúuseful set of frames‚Äù to assist in efficiently bootstrapping, designing, and managing component & function libraries‚Äîusing industry best practices, to reach one of the broadest user bases possible.
